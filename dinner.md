## RICE AND BEANS

[üîù Back to contents](#contents)

Main bag:
- 1 can beans, dehyrated = ~3/4 cup dehydrated
- 1 cup minute rice
- cumin/coriander/cayanne/salt/pepper mix (1 tbsp or a little more)
- bouillon cube, unwrapped (if you'll cook it before it gets manky)

Veg bag:
- 2T dried onion
- 2T dried pepper
- 1T dried green chile (4g ish?)
- 1/2 dried diced tomato (equiv. of 14oz can) (~8g)
OR
- dried can of tomatoes w/ chiles

From lunch bag:
- cheese

New tech:
Put veggies in secondary bowl. Boil 8oz water, then pour over veggies and let sit. Make your hot chocolate while it rehydrates. Then, put another 8oz water into the pot and pour in the water and veggies. Bring to a boil, then add the rice+beans bag. Stir, cover. Cut cheese; stir and put cheese on top, cover, and wait again.

Old tech:
Pre-soak veggies in somewhere between 1 3/4 and 2 1/4 cups water, for 30m maybe.
Boil the water w/ the veggies in it.
Once boiling, add main bag and stop heat. Mash the bouillon cube and mix. Put cheese on top. Cover. Wait.

Notes:
- Water amount depends on veggies! If we want to get scientific, could go w/ 1 3/4 cups for the non-veggie stuff (which was what worked before we got fancy), then test how much water each type of veg uses per weight and calculate how much to add... or just go w/ what sorta worked last time (2 1/4) bc it‚Äôs the woods and who‚Äôs gonna notice.
- Don't pre-soak the whole shebang and then bring to boil. Too much stuff in there, it'll end up not heating all the way through and burning to the bottom. Pre-soak should only be for the veg.


## MAC AND CHEESE AND TUNA

[üîù Back to contents](#contents)

- Annie's, 1 box
    - pasta
    - cheese powder
- packet of tuna
- dried peas (1/2 cup frozen, whatever that comes to when dried)
    - (used to be 1/3 cup)
- nido milk (optional)
- dried parsley
- black pepper

Per NF:
- Soak the pasta and peas together in plenty of cold water for at least 30m.
- Bring pasta and peas to a boil once; wait and check for doneness.
- Drain most of the way.
- Mix in cheese powder and nido, then tuna and spices.
- Ruth packs an arbitrary amount of spices, not a "just right" amount, so add what seems right instead of dumping it all in. <3


## ALFREDO AND SALMON PASTA

[üîù Back to contents](#contents)

- alfredo pasta mix thing ^H^H^H^H^H
    - Replace this w/ something like Annie‚Äôs Alfredo, that keeps the pasta and sauce powder separated!
- Heaping spoon of Nido milk powder
- packet of salmon
- dried peas (1/2 cup frozen, dried)
    - (used to be 1/3 cup)
- dried parsley, dill
- paprika (1 tsp?)
- black pepper

Per NF:
(Assuming we use a two-part Alfredo like Annie's, not the Knorr stuff)
- Soak the pasta and peas together in plenty of cold water for at least 30m.
- Bring pasta and peas to a boil once; wait and check for doneness.
- Drain most of the way.
- Mix in cheese powder and nido, then salmon and spices.
- Ruth packs an arbitrary amount of spices, not a "just right" amount, so add what seems right instead of dumping it all in. <3

(If using Knorr combined mix:)
- Cold soak peas alone for AT LEAST an hour.
- Boil peas with only the amount of water the mix requires.
- Add mix, etc.

## THANKSGIVING LEFTOVERS

[üîù Back to contents](#contents)

https://www.rei.com/blog/camp/backpacking-recipes-thanksgiving-in-a-collapsible-bowl

- instant stuffing
- instant gravy
    - bring 1/4 - 1/3 of a normal packet.
- instant taters (butter flavor)
- packet of chicken
    - Plan ahead to find some kind of unflavored chicken, because that lemon pepper stuff was w a c k. Freddie‚Äôs won‚Äôt have what we need.
- dried peas
- dried cranberries

Soak peas in cold water as soon as you hit camp (or set reminder).

Cook gravy first (insert packet instructions here) and pour into thermos. Strain pea water into pot, top up to the combined water of the taters and stuffing (see boxes), and add peas back in. Boil, then add taters, stuffing, cranberries, and chicken, and cover. Stir.

Notes: This version of the recipe is untested. First time we tried this, it was in three or four parts (stuffing, taters, gravy,) and it was incredibly fussy to work w/. Used mixed veggies, which were underwhelming, and decided we‚Äôd rather just have peas. Also we made 4x the gravy we could eat and had to bury it in a cat hole, which was humiliating and gross (but also totally hilarious).

## THAI RED CURRY CHICKEN

[üîù Back to contents](#contents)

https://www.thrueat.com/backpacking-recipes/chicken-thai-curry

(for 2 people)

Prep: **Two bags.** First bag is almost everything, second is just the coconut cream powder. Also: Check total volume of the main contents, and write it down on the bag for use in the field.

**Main bag:**

- 140g rice

    - (increased from 5g)

- Mix in coconut powder.

Per original recipe:
> 1. Empty contents of Bag 1 into a pot and fill with enough water to cover all ingredients by an inch.
> 2 Place on stove and bring to a simmer. Add more water as needed.
> 3. Remove from heat, cover and let sit for 5-10 minutes.
