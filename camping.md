# Almanac

Dehydrated beans are supposedly 1:1 ratio (by volume) for rehydrating. A can of beans comes out to a little less than a cup of dried beans.

Minute rice is also 1:1 by volume! You hit with boiling water, then let it sit for 5 minutes and then fluff it.

Nido milk: 4:1.

Instant oats are 2:1.

Instant mashed taters are ~ 2:1? It's 1/2 cup water per ounce (by weight), so write down how much you're packing if you aren't using the original packaging.

Red curry paste -- once dehydrated and ground into powder, its density is 2 grams per 1 teaspoon.

Jasmine or basmati rice --
- 3/4 cup water rehydrates 1/2 cup rice (uncooked amt) (or 70g dehydrated cooked).
- 1 cup uncooked yields 140g cooked-and-dehydrated rice... and 1/2 cup uncooked (so 70g dried) feeds both of us when served with a meal that has lentils in it. The red curry uses a bit more, over 3/4 cup uncooked, and we handle the rehydration differently.


# Dry/wet equivalencies

- 1 can white beans = ~1 cup dehydrated white beans (~80g)
- 1 can black beans = 7/8 cup dehydrated (~90g)
- 1 can chickpeas = ~3/4 cup dehydrated chickpeas (~90g)
- 1 1/2 cup frozen peas = ~1/3 cup dehydrated
  - 1/2 cup frozen frozen peas = 1/9 cup dehydrated  = 16/3 tsp (5.3 tsp so like 1T + 2tsp)

https://www.thrueat.com/backpacking-recipes/parmesan-spinach-and-bacon-grits

Prep: Combine all in one bag. (Original recipe had two bags, but it's fine.)

- 2/3 cup grits
- 2T onions
- 1T dried bell pepper
- 10g dried spinach (big handful - 1/2 cup? - dried)
- 2T butter powder
- 2T parmesan cheese (4T was too much) + 1T cheddar cheese
- 2 dashes black pepper
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 2T immitation bacon

- 1 cup (1/2 cup per person) potatoes (butter flavor)
- cheddar cheese

otherwise:
- 1 cup (1/2 cup per person) potatoes (loaded or other flavor)
- some butter powder, cheese powder, bacon bits, maybe scallions

## Lunch

### HUMMUS

For August 20:
- 70g hummus powder
- start with 1/2 cup water
- olive oil

Rehydrate carefully -- it uses way less water than anything else (1/4 c?), but at least it goes fast, so you can watch how it's handling it.
Serve with plain rye crisps and salami.

### RED PEPPER HUMMUS

pre-prep: dried red pepper blend:
- 2 roasted red peppers
- a little less than 1 chipotle chili in adobo
    - The goal here is to not give Ruth acid reflux. <3
- mix in food processor, dehydrate
    - this made 35g first time, split that across 2 meals

Prep: This is a full lunch amount, and since it's more homogenous than a couscous and it's not possible to derive the right amount of water to use anyway (apart from trial and error), you might as well just pack it in a single bag.

- 70g hummus powder
- ~17g pepper powder
- 1/4 - 1/2 tsp true lemon (1 tsp too much)
- 2 packets olive oil
- Caraway rye crisps

Rehydrate interactively in a Talenti jar in the morning. You can never guess the right amount of water to use a priori, so just keep mixing until it works, and then you'll need to add more once it's lunchtime anyway. :shrug:

### BEAN DIP

Recipe: pg. 68 in Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'

Pack as full 2-person lunch.
Cold soak with 1 cup water.
Olive oil
Caraway rye crisps.

Cold soak (per batch): add 1 cup water, pack, eat for lunch.

Notes: Previously, we made this with 1 cup couscous, but it was too much food for 2 people. Also, a 3-1 water ratio was too much; 2.5-1 was closer.

## Dinner

### RICE AND BEANS

Main bag:
- 1 can beans, dehyrated = ~3/4 cup dehydrated
- 1 cup minute rice
- cumin/coriander/cayanne/salt/pepper mix (1 tbsp or a little more)
- bouillon cube, unwrapped (if you'll cook it before it gets manky)

Veg bag:
- 2T dried onion
- 2T dried pepper
- 1T dried green chile (4g ish?)
- 1/2 dried diced tomato (equiv. of 14oz can) (~8g)
OR
- dried can of tomatoes w/ chiles

From lunch bag:
- cheese

New tech:
Put veggies in secondary bowl. Boil 8oz water, then pour over veggies and let sit. Make your hot chocolate while it rehydrates. Then, put another 8oz water into the pot and pour in the water and veggies. Bring to a boil, then add the rice+beans bag. Stir, cover. Cut cheese; stir and put cheese on top, cover, and wait again.

Old tech:
Pre-soak veggies in somewhere between 1 3/4 and 2 1/4 cups water, for 30m maybe.
Boil the water w/ the veggies in it.
Once boiling, add main bag and stop heat. Mash the bouillon cube and mix. Put cheese on top. Cover. Wait.

Notes:
- Water amount depends on veggies! If we want to get scientific, could go w/ 1 3/4 cups for the non-veggie stuff (which was what worked before we got fancy), then test how much water each type of veg uses per weight and calculate how much to add... or just go w/ what sorta worked last time (2 1/4) bc it’s the woods and who’s gonna notice.
- Don't pre-soak the whole shebang and then bring to boil. Too much stuff in there, it'll end up not heating all the way through and burning to the bottom. Pre-soak should only be for the veg.


### MAC AND CHEESE AND TUNA

- Annie's, 1 box
    - pasta
    - cheese powder
- packet of tuna
- dried peas (1/2 cup frozen, whatever that comes to when dried)
    - (used to be 1/3 cup)
- nido milk (optional)
- dried parsley
- black pepper

Per NF:
- Soak the pasta and peas together in plenty of cold water for at least 30m.
- Bring pasta and peas to a boil once; wait and check for doneness.
- Drain most of the way.
- Mix in cheese powder and nido, then tuna and spices.
- Ruth packs an arbitrary amount of spices, not a "just right" amount, so add what seems right instead of dumping it all in. <3


### ALFREDO AND SALMON PASTA

- alfredo pasta mix thing ^H^H^H^H^H
    - Replace this w/ something like Annie’s Alfredo, that keeps the pasta and sauce powder separated!
- Heaping spoon of Nido milk powder
- packet of salmon
- dried peas (1/2 cup frozen, dried)
    - (used to be 1/3 cup)
- dried parsley, dill
- paprika (1 tsp?)
- black pepper

Per NF:
(Assuming we use a two-part Alfredo like Annie's, not the Knorr stuff)
- Soak the pasta and peas together in plenty of cold water for at least 30m.
- Bring pasta and peas to a boil once; wait and check for doneness.
- Drain most of the way.
- Mix in cheese powder and nido, then salmon and spices.
- Ruth packs an arbitrary amount of spices, not a "just right" amount, so add what seems right instead of dumping it all in. <3

(If using Knorr combined mix:)
- Cold soak peas alone for AT LEAST an hour.
- Boil peas with only the amount of water the mix requires.
- Add mix, etc.

### THANKSGIVING LEFTOVERS

https://www.rei.com/blog/camp/backpacking-recipes-thanksgiving-in-a-collapsible-bowl

- instant stuffing
- instant gravy
    - bring 1/4 - 1/3 of a normal packet.
- instant taters (butter flavor)
- packet of chicken
    - Plan ahead to find some kind of unflavored chicken, because that lemon pepper stuff was w a c k. Freddie’s won’t have what we need.
- dried peas
- dried cranberries

Soak peas in cold water as soon as you hit camp (or set reminder).

Cook gravy first (insert packet instructions here) and pour into thermos. Strain pea water into pot, top up to the combined water of the taters and stuffing (see boxes), and add peas back in. Boil, then add taters, stuffing, cranberries, and chicken, and cover. Stir.

Notes: This version of the recipe is untested. First time we tried this, it was in three or four parts (stuffing, taters, gravy,) and it was incredibly fussy to work w/. Used mixed veggies, which were underwhelming, and decided we’d rather just have peas. Also we made 4x the gravy we could eat and had to bury it in a cat hole, which was humiliating and gross (but also totally hilarious).

### THAI RED CURRY CHICKEN
