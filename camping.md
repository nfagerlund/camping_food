(ORIGINAL MOVED TO "RUTH AND NICK SHOW" SHARED FOLDER)

Dehydrated beans are supposedly 1-1 ratio (by volume) for rehydrating. A can of beans comes out to a little less than a cup of dried beans.

Minute rice is also 1-1 by volume! You hit with boiling water, then let it sit for 5 minutes and then fluff it.

Nido milk: 1/4 cup to 1 cup water.

Instant oats are 2-1.

Instant mashed taters are 1-1.

RICE AND BEANS

Main bag:
- dehydrated beans, 1 can
- minute rice, 1 cup
- cumin/coriander/cayanne/salt/pepper mix (1 tbsp or a little more)
- bouillon cube, unwrapped (if you'll cook it before it gets manky)

Veg bag:
- dried onion and pepper
- dried can of tomatoes w/ chiles

From lunch bag:
- cheese

Pre-soak veggies in somewhere between 1 3/4 and 2 1/4 cups water, for 30m maybe.
Boil the water w/ the veggies in it.
Once boiling, add main bag and stop heat. Mash the bouillon cube and mix. Put cheese on top. Cover. Wait.

Notes:
- Water amount depends on veggies! If we want to get scientific, could go w/ 1 3/4 cups for the non-veggie stuff (which was what worked before we got fancy), then test how much water each type of veg uses per weight and calculate how much to add... or just go w/ what sorta worked last time (2 1/4) bc it’s the woods and who’s gonna notice.
- Don't pre-soak the whole shebang and then bring to boil. Too much stuff in there, it'll end up not heating all the way through and burning to the bottom. Pre-soak should only be for the veg.


OATMEAL

- 1 cup "minute oats" from the bulk bins
- Heaping spoon of Nido milk powder
- dried coconut milk
- Handful of trail mix
- freeze dried raspberries
- coconut flakes
- chia seeds
- brown sugar

Boil 2 cups water and add everything.

COUSCOUS THING

- couscous, 3/4 cup
- dehydrated white beans (1 can)
- sun-dried tomatoes
- spices, pre-mixed in:
    - paprika
    - oregano
    - basil
    - salt
    - pepper
    - garlic powder
- olives in a packet
- capers in a lil ziplock
- olive oil
- bouillion cube
- dried onions

Boil 2 1/4 cups water (1 7/8 c. plus some for dried onions) and add everything.

Notes: Previously, we made this with 1 cup couscous, but it was too much food for 2 people. Also, a 3-1 water ratio was too much; 2.5-1 was closer.

MAC AND CHEESE AND TUNA

- Annie's, 1 box
    - pasta
    - cheese powder
- packet of tuna
- dried peas
- nido milk (optional)
- dried parsley
- black pepper

Soak the pasta and peas together in cold water as soon as you get to camp! Or make a reminder/timer to do it as soon as practical if you aren’t cooking soon.

Bring pasta and peas to a boil once, then mix in cheese powder and nido, then other stuff.


ALFREDO AND SALMON PASTA

- alfredo pasta mix thing ^H^H^H^H^H
    - Replace this w/ something like Annie’s Alfredo, that keeps the pasta and sauce powder separated!
- Heaping spoon of Nido milk powder
- packet of salmon
- dried peas
- dried parsley, dill
- paprika (1 tsp?)
- black pepper

Assuming we find a two-part Alfredo: soak the pasta and peas as soon as you make camp (or set a reminder to do it).

Bring pasta and peas to a boil once, then mix in cheese powder and nido, then other stuff.

Notes: last time I guessed wrong that the peas would 1: absorb 1/4c water, and 2: be ready fast enough. Ended up w/ Alfredo soup w/ chewy peas.

THANKSGIVING LEFTOVERS
https://www.rei.com/blog/camp/backpacking-recipes-thanksgiving-in-a-collapsible-bowl

- instant stuffing
- instant gravy
    - bring 1/4 - 1/3 of a normal packet.
- instant taters (butter flavor)
- packet of chicken
    - Plan ahead to find some kind of unflavored chicken, because that lemon pepper stuff was w a c k. Freddie’s won’t have what we need.
- dried peas
- dried cranberries

Soak peas in cold water as soon as you hit camp (or set reminder).

Cook gravy first (insert packet instructions here) and pour into thermos. Strain pea water into pot, top up to the combined water of the taters and stuffing (see boxes), and add peas back in. Boil, then add taters, stuffing, cranberries, and chicken, and cover. Stir.

Notes: This version of the recipe is untested. First time we tried this, it was in three or four parts (stuffing, taters, gravy,) and it was incredibly fussy to work w/. Used mixed veggies, which were underwhelming, and decided we’d rather just have peas. Also we made 4x the gravy we could eat and had to bury it in a cat hole, which was humiliating and gross (but also totally hilarious).
