# Almanac

Dehydrated beans are supposedly 1:1 ratio (by volume) for rehydrating. A can of beans comes out to a little less than a cup of dried beans.

Minute rice is also 1:1 by volume! You hit with boiling water, then let it sit for 5 minutes and then fluff it.

Nido milk: 4:1.

Instant oats are 2:1.

Instant mashed taters are ~ 2:1? It's 1/2 cup water per ounce (by weight), so write down how much you're packing if you aren't using the original packaging.

Red curry paste -- once dehydrated and ground into powder, its density is 2 grams per 1 teaspoon.

Jasmine or basmati rice --
- 3/4 cup water rehydrates 1/2 cup rice (uncooked amt) (or 70g dehydrated cooked).
- 1 cup uncooked yields 140g cooked-and-dehydrated rice... and 1/2 cup uncooked (so 70g dried) feeds both of us when served with a meal that has lentils in it. The red curry uses a bit more, over 3/4 cup uncooked, and we handle the rehydration differently.


# Dry/wet equivalencies

- 1 can white beans = ~1 cup dehydrated white beans (~80g)
- 1 can black beans = 7/8 cup dehydrated (~90g)
- 1 can chickpeas = ~3/4 cup dehydrated chickpeas (~90g)
- 1 1/2 cup frozen peas = ~1/3 cup dehydrated
  - 1/2 cup frozen frozen peas = 1/9 cup dehydrated  = 16/3 tsp (5.3 tsp so like 1T + 2tsp)
