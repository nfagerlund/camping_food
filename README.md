# Almanac

## Snacks

- Dried mango: A TJ's bag = 170g and is enough for like four days.

- Trail mix: Plan on 260g per person per day. It's possible we'll want more on the third+ week of a trip, but that's a known-good baseline. (This is the 2024 revised value.)

## Ingredients

- Dehydrated beans are supposedly 1:1 ratio (by volume) for rehydrating. A can of beans comes out to a little less than a cup of dried beans.

- Minute rice is also 1:1 by volume! You hit with boiling water, then let it sit for 5 minutes and then fluff it.

- Nido milk: 4:1.

- Instant oats are 2:1.

- Instant mashed taters are ~ 2:1? It's 1/2 cup water per ounce (by weight), so write down how much you're packing if you aren't using the original packaging.

- Red curry paste -- once dehydrated and ground into powder, its density is 2 grams per 1 teaspoon.

- Curries

- Jasmine or basmati rice --
    - For indian curries, we dehydrate 1 cup of cooked rice per person per meal.
        - That's roughly 50g dehydrated cooked rice per person.
    - 3/4 cup water rehydrates the rice for both of us.
    - The red curry uses a bit more, over 3/4 cup uncooked, and we handle the rehydration differently.

### Packets

The narrow type of mealsaver bag is best for this, because it divides neatly into 3 (double-sealing on the vertical stripes so you get a cuttable air channel between packets). Freeze packets before trying to vacuum seal... but don't bother trying to get air out of the soy sauce bc it will never freeze.

- Ghee: 1.5 T per packet (one packet does two person-meals of a lentil dish). Hardens fast in freezer.
- Coconut oil: Probably also 1.5 T.
- Soy sauce: a commercial "packet" is about a teaspoon. (Sojourner noodles takes two "packets," so do 2+ tsp if making our own.)
- Toasted sesame oil: 1 T per packet. Hardens slowly to a stiff slush in freezer.

### Dry/wet equivalencies

- 1 can white beans = ~1 cup dehydrated white beans (~80g)
- 1 can black beans = 7/8 cup dehydrated (~90g)
- 1 can chickpeas = ~3/4 cup dehydrated chickpeas (~90g)
- 1 1/2 cup frozen peas = ~1/3 cup dehydrated
  - 1/2 cup frozen frozen peas = 1/9 cup dehydrated  = 16/3 tsp (5.3 tsp so like 1T + 2tsp)
