## HUMMUS

[🔝 Back to contents](#contents)

For August 20:
- 70g hummus powder
- start with 1/2 cup water
- olive oil

Rehydrate carefully -- it uses way less water than anything else (1/4 c?), but at least it goes fast, so you can watch how it's handling it.
Serve with plain rye crisps and salami.

## RED PEPPER HUMMUS

[🔝 Back to contents](#contents)

pre-prep: dried red pepper blend:
- 2 roasted red peppers
- a little less than 1 chipotle chili in adobo
    - The goal here is to not give Ruth acid reflux. <3
- mix in food processor, dehydrate
    - this made 35g first time, split that across 2 meals

Prep: This is a full lunch amount, and since it's more homogenous than a couscous and it's not possible to derive the right amount of water to use anyway (apart from trial and error), you might as well just pack it in a single bag.

- 70g hummus powder
- ~17g pepper powder
- 1/4 - 1/2 tsp true lemon (1 tsp too much)
- 2 packets olive oil
- Caraway rye crisps

Rehydrate interactively in a Talenti jar in the morning. You can never guess the right amount of water to use a priori, so just keep mixing until it works, and then you'll need to add more once it's lunchtime anyway. :shrug:

## BEAN DIP

Recipe: pg. 68 in Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'

Pack as full 2-person lunch (i.e. it's both first and second lunch).

1. cook beans
2. saute onion and garlic in oil unil softened
3. add tomatoes, seasonings, chili and beans
4. simmer over low heat until flavors blend
5. run through foot processor until chopped but not pureed

Dinner:
Boil 2 1/4 cups water (1 7/8 c. plus some for dried onions) and add everything.

Cold soak (per batch): add 1 cup water, pack, eat for lunch.

Notes: Previously, we made this with 1 cup couscous, but it was too much food for 2 people. Also, a 3-1 water ratio was too much; 2.5-1 was closer.
