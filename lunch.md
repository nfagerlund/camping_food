# Lunch

## HUMMUS

For August 20:
- 70g hummus powder
- start with 1/2 cup water
- olive oil

Rehydrate carefully -- it uses way less water than anything else (1/4 c?), but at least it goes fast, so you can watch how it's handling it.
Serve with plain rye crisps and salami.

## RED PEPPER HUMMUS

pre-prep: dried red pepper blend:
- 2 roasted red peppers
- a little less than 1 chipotle chili in adobo
    - The goal here is to not give Ruth acid reflux. <3
- mix in food processor, dehydrate
    - this made 35g first time, split that across 2 meals

Prep: This is a full lunch amount, and since it's more homogenous than a couscous and it's not possible to derive the right amount of water to use anyway (apart from trial and error), you might as well just pack it in a single bag.

- 70g hummus powder
- ~17g pepper powder
- 1/4 - 1/2 tsp true lemon (1 tsp too much)
- 2 packets olive oil
- Caraway rye crisps

Rehydrate interactively in a Talenti jar in the morning. You can never guess the right amount of water to use a priori, so just keep mixing until it works, and then you'll need to add more once it's lunchtime anyway. :shrug:

## BEAN DIP

Recipe: pg. 68 in Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'

Pack as full 2-person lunch.
Cold soak with 1 cup water.
Olive oil
Caraway rye crisps.

## WHITE BEAN COUSCOUS

Prep: Make two bags per lunch, and put HALF of each ingredient into each.

- couscous, 2/3 cup (150g of the whole wheat TJ's stuff)
- dehydrated white beans (1 can)
- sun-dried tomatoes (1/3 - 1/2 cup, 40-45g)
- 1.5T dried onions
- (1T dried pepper)
- bouillion cube (1 tsp)
- spices, pre-mixed in:
    - paprika (1/2tsp)
    - oregano (1tsp)
    - basil (1tsp)
    - salt (1/2tsp)
    - pepper (1/2tsp)
    - garlic powder (1/2tsp)

Separately:
- olives in a packet
- capers in a lil ziplock
- olive oil x2

Dinner:
Boil 2 1/4 cups water (1 7/8 c. plus some for dried onions) and add everything.

Lunch:
Pack as two batches, first and second lunch. (Full amount needs a liter of capacity, talenti jar is a pint.)
Cold soak (per batch): add 1 cup water, pack, eat for lunch.

Notes: Previously, we made this with 1 cup couscous, but it was too much food for 2 people. Also, a 3-1 water ratio was too much; 2.5-1 was closer.
